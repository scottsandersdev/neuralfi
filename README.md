# Neuralfi

Neuralfi is an attempt to use a neural network to analyze user drawn shapes (using <a href="http://paperjs.org/" target="_blank">paper js</a> and <a href="http://caza.la/synaptic" target="_blank">synaptic</a>) in the browser. This will eventually become a game, similar to the 2016 google halloween doodle, where the user draws shapes to defeat enemies

### TODO
clean the array -
* 1. choose either minimum size for array or pick smallest drawn array length.
* 2. use a PRNG to randomly select nodes to remove to normalize all arrays.
* 3. send to synaptic


### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
