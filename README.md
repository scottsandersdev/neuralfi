# neuralfi
## Neuralfi is an attempt to use a neural network to analyze user drawn shapes (using paper.js and synaptic.js) in the browser. This will eventually become a game, similar to the 2016 google halloween doodle, where the user draws shapes to defeat enemies

## TODO - clean the array - 1. choose either minimum size for array or pick smallest drawn array length. 2. use a PRNG to randomly select nodes to remove to normalize all arrays. 3. send to synaptic

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
